# spellchecker
This project is used to create a basic spell checker that checks one word against a database with 460K+ english words using PHP.

The design of this project will stay the same as the project was used to practice the functionality of PHP. 

The file containing the english words (English.txt) was not created by me and was used from this repository: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.
